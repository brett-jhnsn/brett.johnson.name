                    <h2>Company History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Falcon Logic is a Washington DC Area local firm established in 2009. After experiencing the difficulties of working with
                        local software engineers, the group discovered the dire need of businesses to have a resource that could make the art
                        of developing software an enjoyable experience. They knew that the process could be an experience that didn’t actually
                        create a client more work and could in fact encourage creativity and innovation if approached in the right way. The spirit of Falcon
                        Logic is not only to deliver quality software, but to be realistic and honest with its costs, expectations, and most
                        importantly have a good time during the process. We provide service with a smile and a development process (FULCRUM)
                        that sparks creativity in our clients and doesn’t mire them down with additional work. The benefits of this approach have proven very
                        fruitful. Our business continually grows primarily through referrals.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through continuous development, professionalism, integrity and commitment to our clients; our mission is to deliver
                        software solutions with a smile while building creative applications our clients can be proud of.
