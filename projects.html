                        The projects I've worked on in almost 20 years cover the gamut from VB6 data entry systems
                        to mobile applications, C# web apps, progressive web apps, and VB.NET/C# WinForms applications.

                                is a C# WebForms app with a SQL Server 2016 backend. We started this project in 2011 as a replacement for a legacy
                                ColdFusion/Oracle system. The system is responsible for handling procurements for most of the IC.

                            <p>
                                I build an Apache Cordova mobile application for the Android platform called RegionAlert as a prototype for a government customer.
                                This application's objective was to allow the collection of geospatially coordinated intelligence data and then allow that intelligence to be
                                pushed to mobile subscribers in real time. In other words, a user could indicate there was a fire at x/y lat/long, and then other users would receive
                                that intelligence when they came within a specified radius of that geolocation. A central service stored all the notifications in a SQL Server database
                                and was called from the mobile device using a C# REST Api. Google cloud messaging was used to push notifications to the mobile device.

                            <h3>Talon/MediaSnap</h3>
                            <p>
                                I built a mobile optimized, offline, <a href="https://mediasnap.falconlogic.com" title="MediaSnap" target="_blank">cached HTML5 mapping application, MediaSnap</a> as
                                a prototype for a government customer. The purpose of this application was
                                to allow agents in the field to annotate a cached offline map in a zero-install Android and web browser application. I built a HTML5 website that was
                                cached using an application manifest. On logging in and specifying a region of interest it would cache map tiles in local storage from a
                                <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org>" title="Open Street Map">OSM (OpenStreetMap)</a> provider.
                                The map was rendered using <a href="http://leafletjs.com/" title="leaflet" target="_blank">leaflet.js</a> and I wrote several custom plugins to allow collection of data. The map supports
                                textual, freehand drawing, photographic and video annotations. While the application is offline, the annotations are stored in local storage. Once comms are obtained,
                                the application syncs with the central server using a C# REST Api. Once online, any annotations collected by other users in your geospatial region of interest are
                                automatically pushed to you, cached offline, and displayed on your map for current and future consumption.
